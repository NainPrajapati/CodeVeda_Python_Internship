# Codveda Python Internship – Task Submission

This repository contains all the tasks completed as part of the **Codveda Python Development Internship**.

The tasks are organized level-wise (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced) and demonstrate practical Python programming, file handling, API usage, web scraping, encryption, and algorithmic problem-solving.

---

## 🔹 Level 1 – Basic

### 1. Simple Calculator
- Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Loop-based menu for multiple operations in one run
- Handles invalid input and division by zero

### 2. Number Guessing Game
- Generates a random number between 1 and 100
- Limited number of attempts
- Provides feedback (Too High / Too Low)

### 3. Word Counter
- Reads text from a file
- Counts total number of words
- Handles file not found exceptions

---

## 🔹 Level 2 – Intermediate

### 1. To-Do List Application
- Command-line based task manager
- Add, view, mark complete, and delete tasks
- Tasks stored persistently using JSON

### 2. Web Scraper
- Scrapes data from a website using BeautifulSoup
- Extracts quotes and authors
- Saves scraped data into a CSV file

### 3. API Integration
- Integrates with an external REST API (CoinGecko)
- Fetches live cryptocurrency market data
- Parses and displays JSON response with error handling

---

## 🔹 Level 3 – Advanced

### 1. File Encryption & Decryption
- Encrypts and decrypts files using Fernet symmetric encryption
- Secure key generation and validation
- Menu-based program allowing multiple operations in one run

### 2. N-Queens Problem
- Solves the classic N-Queens problem using backtracking
- Ensures no two queens attack each other
- Demonstrates algorithmic and logical problem-solving skills

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python

## 🚀 How to Run the Projects

### 🔹 Level 1 – Basic Tasks
Run any file using:
```text
python Level1/calculator.py
python Level1/number_guessing_game.py
python Level1/word_counter.py
```
🔹 Level 2 – Intermediate Tasks

Install required libraries (once):

pip install requests beautifulsoup4

Run the programs:
```text
python Level2/todo.py
python Level2/scraper.py
python Level2/api_integration.py
```
🔹 Level 3 – Advanced Tasks

Install encryption library (once):

pip install cryptography

Run the programs:
```text
python Level3/encrypt_decrypt.py
python Level3/n_queens.py
```
📌 Notes

All programs are command-line based

Follow on-screen instructions for inputs

Output files (CSV / encrypted files) are generated automatically

✅ Status

All tasks have been successfully implemented, tested, and are working as expected.
